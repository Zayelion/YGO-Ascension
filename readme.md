#Opening Letter to the Community
>Dear Konami Executive,
Fuck you for being so incompetent. To show you how incompetent you are I'm going to parody your work for the sake of teaching others how not to be an unapologic tyranical failure of an intellectual property manager.

>Dear Developer,
Fuck you for not taking my pull request, not writing unit test, breaking API on every commit, making my life a general hell with buggy software, sending a god damn psychopath after me, making me deal with your megalomanical staffers, your "Im not powerful enough staffers", and causing a social malestrom that likely resulted in the suicide of a few teenagers.

>Dear User,
Fuck you. For waking me, yelling at me, telling me off when I try to help you and basically being a childish fuck nugget.
