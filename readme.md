#Opening Letter to the Community
> I'm building this application out of pure frustration and I invite the community to follow me in this adventure. This project is an education tool that will parody the poor game development cycle of Konami and its strategic partners. I want this project to serve as a lesson to AAA game development studios on how to properly make money in this economic climate without abusing an IP's source material. Konami waste millions of dollars developing games no one wants for an IP everyone loves, when things like Heartstone rake in the cash. Niantic's servers are at max and profits soaring, and the mobile market is growing.

#Contributing
To conribute first write up a requirement, this is manditory. Do a pull request for that requirement and if the community likes it we will add it to our specification. Then you can do a pull request of the new feature. The feature must have test covering it and not bring the total test coverage of the system down below 85%.

#Installation
